# contactless-temperature-sensor-using-the-MLX90614-and-ESP32
I built a contactless temperature sensor using the MLX90614 and ESP32. It can measure temperature without touching anything and shows the live value on an OLED display. The readings are smooth and accurate, and the LED turns ON automatically when the temperature becomes too high.
