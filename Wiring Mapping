## 🌡️ Contactless Temperature Sensor (MLX90614)

This project also includes a **contactless temperature sensor (MLX90614)** to measure temperature without physical contact.  
The sensor communicates with the ESP32 using the **I2C protocol** and displays readings on the OLED.

## 📌 Pin Mapping – MLX90614 (I2C)

| MLX90614 Pin | ESP32 Pin | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| VIN / VCC    | 3.3V      | Power supply |
| GND          | GND       | Ground |
| SDA          | GPIO 21   | I2C Data |
| SCL          | GPIO 22   | I2C Clock |

> MLX90614 shares the same I2C bus with the OLED display.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- The MLX90614 senses **infrared radiation** from an object
- It calculates temperature without touching the object
- ESP32 reads the temperature via I2C
- The OLED displays real-time temperature values
- An alert (LED/trigger) can be activated if temperature crosses a set threshold

## ⚠️ Notes
- Operating voltage: **3.3V (safe for ESP32)**
- Default I2C address: `0x5A`
- Keep sensor steady for accurate readings
